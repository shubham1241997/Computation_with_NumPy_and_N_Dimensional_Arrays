# Computation_with_NumPy_and_N_Dimensional_Arrays

NumPy is a Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering. It’s practically THE standard for working with numerical data in Python.
The case studies for how NumPy is being used speak for themselves 

Learning:

1. How to leverage the power of NumPy's ndarrays.
2. How to access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array.
3. How broadcasting works with ndarrays.
4. How to do linear algebra with NumPy.
5. How to generate points that you can plot on a chart.
6. How to manipulate images as ndarrays.

Required Libraries:

1. import numpy as np 
2. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
3. from scipy import misc # contains an image of a racoon!
4. from PIL import Image # for reading image files
